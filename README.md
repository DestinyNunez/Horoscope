### Goal: 
Create a horoscope app that can take in the users birthday and return their horoscope.

### How It's Made
I utilized HTML and CSS to structure the elements, style and position them.

### Functionality 
For the logic behind the app I utilized JavaScript and used a function named search which would communicate with the button in the DOM so that each time the user entered their birthday if statments would check if the birthday fell in a certain range and depending on the range it would send back a horoscope of the day and an image of the users zodiac.
